        An HTML Media Capture <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-html-media-capture-20171128/">Proposed Recommendation</a> was published on 28 November 2017, no further normative changes have been made since then.

        Errata for this document are recorded as issues.

        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/dap/wiki/ImplementationStatus">implementation report</a> produced for this version demonstrates there are two independent interoperable implementations.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>HTML Media Capture</cite> specification extends the
        {{HTMLInputElement}} interface with a {{HTMLInputElement/capture}} attribute. The
        [^input/capture^] attribute allows authors to declaratively request use of
        a <a>media capture mechanism</a>, such as a camera or microphone, from
        within a file upload control, for capturing media on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        This extension is specifically designed to be simple and declarative,
        and covers a subset of the media capture functionality of the web
        platform. Specifically, the extension does not provide detailed author
        control over capture. Use cases requiring more fine-grained author
        control may be met by using another specification, <cite>Media Capture
        and Streams</cite> [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]]. For example, access to
        real-time media streams from the hosting device is out of scope for
        this specification.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that
        it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Terminology
      </h2>
      <p>
        <dfn data-cite="HTML/sec-forms.html#element-statedef-input-file-upload">File
        Upload</dfn> state, <dfn data-cite=

        value default</dfn>
        are defined in [[HTML]].
      </p>
      <p>
        In this specification, the term <dfn>capture control type</dfn> refers
        to a specialized type of a file picker control that is optimized, for
        the user, for directly capturing media of a MIME type specified by the
        [^input/accept^] attribute, using a <a>media capture mechanism</a> in its
        <a>preferred facing mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <dfn>media capture mechanism</dfn> refers to a device's local
        media capture device, such as a camera or microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>preferred facing mode</dfn> is a hint for the direction of the
        device's <a>media capture mechanism</a> to be used.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        A User Agent implementation of this specification is advised to seek
        user consent before initiating capture of content by microphone or
        camera. This may be necessary to meet regulatory, legal and best
        practice requirements related to the privacy of user data. In addition,
        the User Agent implementation is advised to provide an indication to
        the user when an input device is enabled and make it possible for the
        user to terminate such capture. Similarly, the User Agent is advised to
        offer user control, such as to allow the user to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>select the exact media capture device to be used if there exist
        multiple devices of the same type (e.g. a front-facing camera in
        addition to a primary camera).
        </li>
        <li>disable sound capture when in the video capture mode.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This specification builds upon the security and privacy protections
        provided by the <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> [[HTML]] and the
        [[FILE-API]] specifications; in particular, it is expected that any
        offer to start capturing content from the user’s device would require a
        specific user interaction on an HTML element that is entirely
        controlled by the user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementors should take care to prevent additional leakage of
        privacy-sensitive data from captured media. For instance, embedding the
        user’s location in the metadata of captured media (e.g. EXIF) might
        transmit more private data than the user is expecting.

        The <dfn>capture</dfn> IDL attribute

      <p>
        When an [^input^] element's [^input/type^] attribute is in the <a>File
        Upload</a> state, and its [^input/accept^] attribute is specified, the
        rules in this section apply.

          The <code><dfn data-dfn-for="input" data-dfn-type="element-attr">capture</dfn></code> content attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a> whose

          capture mechanism</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attribute's keywords are <code><dfn>user</dfn></code>,
          <code><dfn>environment</dfn></code>, and the empty string, which map
          to the <var>user</var>, <var>environment</var>, and the
          <var>implementation-specific</var> state respectively. The semantics
          of the states <var>user</var> and <var>environment</var> mirror the
          similarly named enumeration values defined in
          {{VideoFacingModeEnum}}.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>missing value default</a> is the

        <p class="note">
          If the user agent is unable to support the <a>preferred facing

          behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{HTMLInputElement/capture}} IDL attribute MUST [=Attr/reflect=] the respective
          content attribute of the same name.

        <p>
          When the [^input/capture^] attribute is specified, the <a>user agent</a>

        <p>
          When the [^input/capture^] attribute is specified, the <a>user agent</a>

        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following examples demonstrate how to give hints that it is
        preferred for the user to capture media of a specific MIME type using
        the media capture capabilities of the hosting device. Both a simple
        declarative example using an HTML form, as well as a more advanced
        example including scripting, are presented.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To take a picture using the device's user-facing
        camera, and upload the picture taken using an HTML form:
          <pre class="example html" id="example-1">
          &lt;form action="server.cgi" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
            &lt;input type="file" name="image" accept="image/*" capture="user"&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload"&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Or alternatively, to capture video using the device's local video
        camera facing the environment:
          <pre class="example html">
          &lt;form action="server.cgi" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
            &lt;input type="file" name="video" accept="video/*" capture="environment"&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload"&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Or alternatively, to capture audio using the device's local
        microphone (without <a>preferred facing mode</a> defined, falls back to
        the implementation-specific default facing mode):
          <pre class="example html">
          &lt;form action="server.cgi" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
            &lt;input type="file" name="audio" accept="audio/*" capture&gt;
            &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload"&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>For more advanced
        use cases, specify the [^input/capture^] attribute in markup:
          <pre class="example html" id="example-4">
          &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" capture&gt;
          &lt;canvas&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
        </pre>And handle the file upload in script via `XMLHttpRequest`:
          <pre class="example js">
          var input = document.querySelector('input[type=file]'); // see Example 4

          input.onchange = function () {
            var file = input.files[0];

            upload(file);
            drawOnCanvas(file);   // see Example 6
            displayAsImage(file); // see Example 7
          };

          function upload(file) {
            var form = new FormData(),
                xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

            form.append('image', file);
            xhr.open('post', 'server.php', true);
            xhr.send(form);
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          The image can also be displayed on the client-side without
  uploading it e.g. for client-side image editing purposes, using the {{FileReader}} and a [^canvas^] element:
        </p>
          <pre class="example js">
          function drawOnCanvas(file) {
            var reader = new FileReader();

            reader.onload = function (e) {
              var dataURL = e.target.result,
                  c = document.querySelector('canvas'), // see Example 4
                  ctx = c.getContext('2d'),
                  img = new Image();

              img.onload = function() {
                c.width = img.width;
                c.height = img.height;
                ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
              };

              img.src = dataURL;
            };

            reader.readAsDataURL(file);
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          Or alternatively, to just display the image, using the
          {{URL/createObjectURL()}} method and an [^img^] element:
        </p>
          <pre class="example js">
          function displayAsImage(file) {
            var imgURL = URL.createObjectURL(file),
                img = document.createElement('img');

            img.onload = function() {
              URL.revokeObjectURL(imgURL);
            };

            img.src = imgURL;
            document.body.appendChild(img);
          }
        </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When an [^input^] element's [^input/accept^] attribute is set to
        <code>image/*</code> and the [^input/capture^] attribute is specified as
        in the [[[#example-1]]] or [[[#example-4]]], the file picker can be rendered as
        presented below:
